Yet another Obstacle Avoiding Robot Arduino

I would like to make an obstacle avoiding robot with an Arduino UNO board. Internet is plenty of projects like this but i want to learn how to do it.

First I'm going to need an arduino radar (in reality it's a n arduino sonar, i'm using an ultrasonic sensor). A couple of years before I builded an arduino radar with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) following several projects in internet. It has the arduino board, the ultrasoic sensor, a microservo, a LCD display, a buzzer an a couple of leds. The code is in the radar folder. This is the starting point of this new project
