# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Arduino
Yet another Obstacle Avoiding Robot Arduino

I would like to make an obstacle avoiding robot with an Arduino UNO board. Internet is plenty of projects like this but i want to learn how to do it.

The goal is to mimic a robot vacuum cleaner, trying to recognize the limits of the room, its obstacles and see how to store it.

First I'm going to need an arduino radar (in reality it's an arduino sonar, i'm using an ultrasonic sensor). A couple of years before I builded an arduino radar with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) following several projects in internet. It has the arduino board, the ultrasoic sensor, a microservo, a LCD display, a buzzer an a couple of leds. The code is in the radar folder. This is the starting point of this new project.
